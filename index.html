  <p> One day a little kid was walking through the park with his parents looking around to do something fun. He had the fun idea to go to the store buy some bread and come back to the park just so they could feed the very sweet looking gooses. After a hour goes by playing at the park and having a great time with his family johnny convinces his parents to take him to the store and buy some bread. Once they got back to the park the kid took the bread and walked over to the gooses little did he know the gooses had a different idea.</p>
